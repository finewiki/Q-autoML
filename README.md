# AutoML Project

## Overview

This project is an **AutoML** system currently under active development, designed to automate machine learning processes, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. The project leverages **FLAML** (Fast and Lightweight AutoML) for model optimization and selection, aiming to provide an efficient and scalable solution for automating machine learning pipelines.

## Current Status

The project is still in the **development phase** and not yet in production. Several components, such as data processing, model training, and performance evaluations, have been implemented and are undergoing refinement and testing. 

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatically processes raw financial data, including outlier detection and feature engineering.
- **Model Training**: Uses FLAML for efficient and automated model selection, fine-tuning, and training.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates models based on key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Model Deployment**: Once trained, models can be deployed for prediction and analysis.
- **Multi-Language Support**: The system integrates several programming languages including Python, Go, Rust, R, and Java for various parts of the system to ensure performance and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for core logic and machine learning functionality.
- **FLAML** for AutoML model optimization.
- **Go** for microservices in data processing.
- **Rust** for performance-critical feature engineering tasks.
- **R** for statistical analysis and reporting.
- **Java** for certain backend functionalities.
- **Docker** for containerizing the services and orchestration using Docker Compose.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autoML.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** for Python (using `requirements.txt`), Go, Java, Rust, etc.

   For Python:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Docker setup** (Recommended for running the complete system with all services):

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the services** through the respective ports for the frontend, data processing, model training, and API services.

## Contributing

Since this project is still under development, contributions are welcomed, especially in the following areas:

- Improving data preprocessing and feature engineering functions.
- Enhancing model selection and optimization processes.
- Adding more tests for the system.
- Documentation improvements.

Please create a pull request for any enhancements, bug fixes, or features you want to contribute.
